![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84629565/196043203-bbecb6aa-9ed5-4262-a6b4-0785d5c79e46.png)
> For this project I created the initial data structure for a vet clinic using a relational database. I started with one table animals and created a complete database about owners, vets, visits, species and specializations information.

## Built With

- Relational Database PostgreSQL
- Visual Studio Code
- Schema Diagram [drawSQL](https://drawsql.app/)
## Schema Diagram
In progress :smile:
## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
